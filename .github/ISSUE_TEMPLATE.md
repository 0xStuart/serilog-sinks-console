Hi ðŸ‘‹

If you have a question about using Serilog, or something isn't working as you expect it to, please post your question to the [`serilog` tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/serilog), where many more people are ready to help you out.

To report a bug or request a feature, please give us as much information as possible, for example:

 - [ ] the exact package id and version you're using,
 - [ ] your `dotnet` toolchain version, target framework, and operating system,
 - [ ] the current behavior, and
 - [ ] what you expect or want to happen instead.

Thanks!
